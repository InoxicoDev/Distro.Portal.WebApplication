# Distro.Portal.WebApplication
The Web Portal on the Distributed Spike

**Web Application**
- [X] Distributing repositories for single repo deployments with shared dependancies
- [x] Run collapased microservices during development but deploy distributed
- [ ] Website Design Architecture

**Concerns**
- [ ] Duplicated configuration (attached shared partial config for each microservice?)
- [ ] Complex GIT management (Can we do recursive submodule checkout and update scripts?)
- [ ] Shared Domain Service interfaces with consumer proxy implimentations (Do we need another layer of abstraction?)
